        <p><a href="google.com">Billie Eilish</a> has released her new single 
        <a href="google.com">"my future."</a> She wrote and recorded the 
        track (produced by her brother <a href="google.com">FINNEAS</a>)
        during the <a href="google.com">coronavirus</a> lockdown. "it's a 
        song that's really really personal and special to me," Eilish wrote 
        in a statement to fans. "When we wrote this song, it was exactly 
        where my head was at-hopeful, excited and a craaaaazy amount 
        of self reflection and self growth. But recently it has also 
        taken on a lot of new meaning in the context of what's happening 
        in the world now. I hope you can all find meaning in it for yourselves."

        <p>In May 2020, Eilish released a short film titled <a href="google.com">
            Not My Responsibility,</a> which addressed public opinion and 
            perception of her body and clothing choices. The film was originally 
            part of the stage production for her arena tour behind When We Fall 
            Asleep, Where Do We Go?, which lasted only a few dates before she 
            was forced to cancel the rest of her scheduled shows due to the 
            coronavirus pandemic.
